fix do not include NHL/NBA packages in crestron sports lineups

Bug = station ids repeated causing software to double dip and downlod same event multiple times. Think this has been solved crudely using sys.setdefaultencoding()

BUG. Need to rework the Make infocaster text file since it used to pull date from the sports schedule but now it has to pull date from live sports. This is going to be fun.
